In this project, I used the data available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48558 to pinpoint important genes that may cause leukemia. This data
contains two groups of "Normal" and "Patient" samples. After reducing the dimension of the data using PCA, I found out the P-value of each gene and assessed whether they
could be the cause of Leukemia or not.
